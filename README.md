AngularJS Datatype Editors (ADE)
===

ADE is a bunch of filters and directives for displaying and editing various types of data in an <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> App.  For example, if you have a unix timestamp that you want to display and make editable, ADE can display a formatted date string and make a popup calendar for editing. 

ADE currently supports the following datatypes:

- Text (short)
- Text (long)
- URL
- Email Address
- Phone number
- Date
- Date + Time
- Year
- Time
- Money
- Decimal
- Integer
- Percent
- Length
- List (pick one)
- List (pick multiple)
- Rating
- Boolean
- Icon
