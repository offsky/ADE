Installation Instructions
=========================

1) Download the minified css and js files and adeImg image directory, and place into your project. 
	These are located in the build directory.

	External Dependencies: You will need to install the following external dependencies
		a) Jquery 1.10.2
		b) Angular 1.0.x and angular-sanitize
		c) Font Awesome (for icon directive only)
		d) Bootstrap v2.3.2 css. (for date, email, icon, list, phone, rich, time, url)
		e) TinyMCE 4.0.4 (for rich directive only) Use our modified version if you want keyboard commands to work.

	We are working to reduce external dependencies as much as possible.


2) Inject ADE in your angular project

	var app = angular.module('app', ['ADE', 'ngSanitize']);


3) Use the directives and filters

	<div class="sample" ade-url='{"className":"input-medium"}' ng-model="dataurl" ng-bind-html="dataurl | url"></div>
